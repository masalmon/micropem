# Introduction
```

This package aims at supporting the analysis of PM2.5 measures made with
RTI MicroPEM. [RTI
MicroPEM](https://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/brochures/rti_micropem.pdf)
are personal monitoring devices (PM2.5 and PM10) developed by [RTI
international](https://www.rti.org/).

The goal of the package functions is to help in two main tasks:

-   Checking individual MicroPEM output files after, say, one day of
    data collection.

-   Building a data base based on output files, and clean and transform
    the data for further analysis.

For more information check out the [package
website](http://docs.ropensci.org/rtimicropem/), in particular the
[introductory
vignette](http://docs.ropensci.org/rtimicropem/articles/chai_data_cleaning.html).
